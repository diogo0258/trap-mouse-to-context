This script tries to limit mouse movement to a specific area of the screen, using ClipCursor.

You can select the context to which trap the mouse
- from the tray menu
- with hotkeys. The default ones are:
```
Ctrl+F12    Trap to win
Ctrl+F11    Trap to control
Ctrl+F10    Trap to rectangle
Esc         Free mouse
Ctrl+Alt+Q	Exit
```

The "rectangle" option is done with Lexikos' LetUserSelectRect

Useful for playing flash games and stuff
